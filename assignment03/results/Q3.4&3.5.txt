Q: What is the frequency resolution (difference in frequency between the bins) of the FFT obtained above?

A: The frequency resolution is 1Hz.

Q: How will the frequency resolution change in this case if you zero-pad the input signal
with the same of zeros as the length of the input signal?

A: The frequency resolution will be 0.5Hz.
